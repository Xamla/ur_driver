Xamla UR ROS driver v1.1
```


This package contains a ROS driver completely written in LUA (with [torch-ros](https://github.com/xamla/torch-ros)) for [Universal Robots](https://www.universal-robots.com/) arms (UR3/UR5/UR10).
This project is part of the standard robot drivers that are shipped with Rosvita and therefore is fully supported by the Xamla team.
